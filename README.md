1. Objective
Given a Title and description we have to determine wheater it belongs to which news article category .

1.1 Type of Machine learning problem:
We have to predict the news article on given informartion so it is multiclass Classification problem

1.2 How to determine wheater it belongs to which news article category ?
We can use Natural Language processing technique to convert the given texts to vectors as machine inderstands numbers so by using some of the Data preprossesingtechniques such as Word2Vec, BagofWords ,Tfidf etc etc , and then by using Classification machine learning Algorithm
